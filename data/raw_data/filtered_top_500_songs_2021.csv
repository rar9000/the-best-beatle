I didn&#8217;t realize it at the time; I just wrote the song because I was commissioned to write it for the movie.&#8221; Overwhelmed by Beatlemania, Lennon was eating &#8220;like a pig,&#8221; drinking too much, and &#8220;smoking marijuana for breakfast&#8221; — only 24 years old, he was already expressing nostalgia for his lost youth. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like the recording that much,&#8221; Lennon would later tell <i>Rolling Stone.</i> &#8220;We did it too fast, to try and be commercial.&#8221;</p>

Penny Lane was a Liverpool bus stop where Lennon and McCartney often met. &#8220;The song was generated by a kind of &#8216;I can do just as well as you can, John,&#8217; because we&#8217;d just recorded &#8216;Strawberry Fields,'&#8221; said George Martin. &#8220;It was such a knockout, I think Paul went back to perfect his idea.” There was collaboration amid the competition, too: &#8220;John came over and helped me with the third verse, as was often the case,&#8221; McCartney said. &#8220;We were writing recently faded memories from eight or 10 years before.&#8221;</p>

McCartney was still just 23 when he wrote this empathetic portrait of old age. He fumbled with the story until he hit on the image “picks up the rice in a church where a wedding has been.” As he said, “So this became a song about lonely people.” None of the Beatles play on it — George Martin conducted an eight-man classical-string section. “Father McKenzie” was originally “Father McCartney”; Lennon and McCartney flipped through a phone book until they found the name they wanted.</p>

When McCartney&#8217;s father heard the song, he said, &#8220;Son, there are enough Americanisms around. Couldn&#8217;t you sing, &#8216;Yes, yes, yes,&#8217; just for once?&#8221; McCartney responded, &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand, Dad. It wouldn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</p>

John Lennon was brutally dismissive, mistaking McCartney&#8217;s secular humanism for self-righteous piety. Yet the Beatles put special labor into the song, getting the consummate take on January 31st — the day after their last live performance, on the roof of their Apple offices in London. Released four months later, &#8220;Let It Be&#8221; effectively became an elegy for the band that had defined the Sixties.</p>

390,1225228,110,The Beatles,Something,1969,['George Harrison'],the-beatles-something-2-1225228,"<p>In 1968, James Taylor, a new signee to the Beatles’ Apple Records, recorded “Something in the Way She Moves,” the title of which inspired George Harrison to write “Something” near the end of the White Album sessions (one place-holder lyric: &#8220;Something in the way she moves/Attracts me like a cauliflower&#8221;). It was too late to squeeze it onto the disc, so he gave it to Joe Cocker. The Beatles cut a new version the next year with a string section, Harrison’s only A-side single with the Beatles, which quickly became a standard recorded by everyone from Frank Sinatra to Ray Charles.</p>

The original lyrics put Lennon on a bus in Liverpool, &#8220;and it was the most boring sort of &#8216;What I Did on My Holidays Bus Trip&#8217; song,&#8221; he said. So Lennon rewrote the lyrics, changing the song into a gorgeous reminiscence about his life before the Beatles. The distinctive &#8220;harpsichord&#8221; solo near the song&#8217;s end is actually an electric piano played by George Martin and sped up on tape.</p>

During the recording sessions, producer George Martin objected to the length, claiming DJs would not play the song. &#8220;They will if it&#8217;s us,&#8221; John Lennon shot back. Paul McCartney wrote &#8220;Hey Jude&#8221; in June 1968, singing to himself on his way to visit Lennon&#8217;s soon-to-be-ex-wife, Cynthia, and their son, Julian. The opening lines were, McCartney once said, &#8220;a hopeful message for Julian: &#8216;Come on, man, your parents got divorced. I know you&#8217;re not happy, but you&#8217;ll be OK.'&#8221; McCartney changed &#8220;Jules&#8221; to &#8220;Jude&#8221; — a name inspired by Jud from the musical <i>Oklahoma!</i></p>

For the climax, they hired 40 musicians, dressed them in tuxedos and funny hats, and told them they had 15 bars to ascend from the lowest note on their instruments to the highest. &#8220;Listen to those trumpets — they&#8217;re freaking out,&#8221; McCartney said.

He wanted to get that idea out.&#8221; Lennon admitted that &#8220;Imagine&#8221; was &#8220;virtually the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>.&#8221; But the elementary beauty of his melody, the warm composure in his voice, and the poetic touch of co-producer Phil Spector — who bathed Lennon&#8217;s performance in gentle strings and summer-breeze echo — emphasized the song&#8217;s fundamental humanity. Lennon knew he had written something special. In one of his last interviews, he declared &#8220;Imagine&#8221; to be as good as anything he had written with the Beatles.</p>

493,1225331,7,The Beatles,Strawberry Fields Forever,1967,"['John Lennon', 'Paul McCartney']",the-beatles-strawberry-fields-forever-2-1225331,"<p>John Lennon was one of the world’s most visible people in 1966 — but he wrote his most exquisitely lonely song with “Strawberry Fields Forever.” It opened up a whole new psychedelic era for the Beatles, changing the way pop music was heard and made.</p>
<p>But it began with Lennon alone on a Spanish beach, with an acoustic guitar, writing a song about his painful childhood memories. Strawberry Field was the name of a Liverpool orphanage where he used to play — and hide from the world — as a boy. “I have visions of Strawberry Fields,” he told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 1968. “Because Strawberry Fields is anywhere you want to go.” Lennon bared himself so vulnerably in this song that he was nervous about playing it for the other Beatles. There was a moment of silence — until Paul McCartney said, “That is absolutely brilliant.” They turned it into a groundbreaking sonic collage, thanks to George Martin’s studio wizardry.</p>
<p>It was the first song cut at the <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> sessions, though it got left off the album so it could come out as a February 1967 single, with McCartney’s “Penny Lane” on the flip side. “Strawberry Fields” is a song full of raw pain — yet the Beatles made it feel like an irresistible invitation.</p>
