Express, features one of Mitchell&#8217;s sultriest vocals and most brocaded arrangements, inspiring Prince, 13 years later, to pay the song lyrical tribute in his &#8220;Ballad of Dorothy Parker.&#8221;</p>\n",

I&#8217;d always be late, and whenever I&#8217;d come in she&#8217;d point at me and say, &#8216;Boom Boom, you&#8217;re late again.&#8217; One night she said, &#8216;Boom boom, I&#8217;m gonna shoot you down.&#8217; She gave me a song, but she didn&#8217;t know it.” Keith Richards said of Hooker, &#8220;Even Muddy Waters was sophisticated next to him.&#8221; That was a compliment.</p>\n",

Buckley wrote the lyrics to the album’s incandescent title track after saying goodbye to his girlfriend at the airport; his close collaborator Gary Lucas came up with the searing, spiraling guitar line. The impact was like hearing Chet Baker reborn in the Nineties, playing a cool Lower East Side bar.</p>\n",

One of the singer&#8217;s next singles took on a markedly different tone, both politically — &#8220;We&#8217;d rather die on our feet, than be livin&#8217; on our knees” — and musically, replacing the easy lope of &#8220;America Is My Home&#8221; with an agitated funk missile. &#8220;Say It Loud&#8221; was a bigger hit than its predecessor, reaching Number One on the R&amp;B chart, in addition to becoming a Black Power anthem.</p>\n",

For the recording, Haggard wanted to mix his hard-driving Bakersfield country sound with folk music — “Somewhere in between Peter, Paul, and Mary and Johnny Cash,” he later said. He ended up with the greatest fugitive anthem in country history.</p>\n",

He agreed.” The rest is history: With its twin verses written by Springsteen and Smith, respectively, “Because the Night” perfectly captured both artists&#8217; hungry-hearted rock &amp; roll spirit, and became Smith’s lone Top 20 hit.</p>\n",

The opening verse was originally recorded in three-part harmony; Prince split up the vocals, and the harmony parts became a new, odd melody. The single&#8217;s first release didn&#8217;t make the Top 40, but Prince put it out again after &#8220;Little Red Corvette,&#8221; and it was finally a hit, reaching the Top 20.

The movie never got made, but the song immediately touched a nerve. As Randy Newman admiringly noted, “‘After the Gold Rush’ is sort of a primal urge for a simpler, better time — which may have never existed, but Neil thinks it does.”</p>\n",

Coltrane’s majestic, often violent blowing on the track is never self-aggrandizing. He soars with nothing but gratitude and joy. You can’t help but go with him.</p>\n",

Sweden&#8217;s biggest musical export debuted &#8220;Queen&#8221; in 1976 at a ball for King Carl XVI Gustaf on the eve of his wedding. The song, a frothy dessert of sublime melody and pop-operatic harmonies, became the group&#8217;s only U.S. Number One.</p>\n",

Here, inspired by the Left Banke’s lovely psych-pop ballad “Walk Away Renee,” he painstakingly constructed the majestic studio-rock symphony that would become Boston’s career-making hit, centered on a vision of Marianne — who, in fact, existed. &#8220;She was my older first cousin, who I had a crush on when I was 10,&#8221; Scholz said. Many accused Nirvana of nicking the chords to the chorus of “Smells Like Teen Spirit” from “More Than a Feeling,” but not Scholz, who’s said simply, “I don&#8217;t hear it.”</p>\n",

But the original recording still felt too shiny, and the band had to borrow £200 to cover the cost of another session. Seventeen-year-old guitarist Dave Davies took a razor to the speaker cone on his amp to get the desired dirty sound for that immortal, blistering riff. &#8220;The song came out of a working-class environment,&#8221; Dave recalled. &#8220;People fighting for something.&#8221;</p>\n",

He gave a songwriting credit to his childhood friend Vincent &#8220;Tata&#8221; Ford to help keep Ford&#8217;s Kingston soup kitchen running.</p>\n",

Producer Shep Pettibone, who’d remixed some of the pop star’s earlier singles, whipped up a booming disco beat and synth bass, then later mixed in syncopated stabs of house piano after Madonna had recorded her vocals in a Manhattan basement. The most amazing part? They did it all on a budget of $5,000, with the idea that something so bold could probably only be a B side.</p>\n",

The Frankie in question was Sinatra: His “My Way” was based on the 1967 song &#8220;Comme d&#8217;habitude,&#8221; by French artist Claude François, for which Bowie had written (rejected) English lyrics. “That really made me angry for so long  —  about a year,” Bowie later joked. He wrote the similar-sounding “Life on Mars?” as “a revenge trip on ‘My Way.’” Accompanied by Rick Wakeman of Yes on piano, Bowie spins the surrealistic tale about the limits of escapism, complete with references to John Lennon’s “Working Class Hero” and the Hollywood Argyles’ “Alley Oop,” a 1960 doo-wop tune about a caveman.</p>\n",

A veteran of Boston coffeehouse gigs (she once got a demo-tape rejection letter suggesting she tune her guitar), Chapman suddenly found herself in the Top 10 and with a Grammy. &#8220;I had so many people come up to me and say that they felt it was their song, and someone told me at one point that they thought I&#8217;ve been reading their mail,&#8221; she once said. &#8220;They were saying, &#8216;You seem to know my story.'&#8221;</p>\n",

That might be why Presley was convinced he could turn the song into a deep soul hit, even though it had flopped in 1968 for singer-songwriter Mark James. Recorded between four and seven in the morning, during the landmark Memphis session that helped return the King to his throne, &#8220;Suspicious Minds&#8221; — the final Number One single of his lifetime — is Presley&#8217;s masterpiece: He sings so intensely through the fade-out that his band returns for another minute of the tear-stained chorus.</p>\n",

So obsessed, he said, &#8220;that I decided to celebrate the word with a song all its own&#8221; — which is how he came to write the Who&#8217;s 1966 hit &#8220;Substitute.&#8221; When Robinson cut &#8220;Tears,&#8221; it was such a clear winner that even hard-to-please Motown founder Berry Gordy proclaimed it a masterpiece.</p>\n",

During the next seven months, in four studios, at a cost of more than $50,000 (at that point the greatest sum ever spent on a single), Wilson built &#8220;Good Vibrations&#8221; in sections, coloring the mood swings with locomotive cello, saloon piano, and the spectral wail of a theremin. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t think about doing it in pieces at first,&#8221; Wilson said years later, &#8220;but after the first few bars in the first verse, we realized that this was going to be a different kind of record.&#8221;</p>\n",

But the song’s impact on dance music is incalculable. Moroder’s decision to jettison disco&#8217;s fluffy orchestrations for throbbing strobe-light-synth minimalism (augmented by his crack team of Munich session musicians) set the table for Euro disco, synth-pop, and wave upon wave of electronic music to come. When Brian Eno first listened to it, he told David Bowie, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard the sound of the future.”</p>\n",

According to the engineer, Prince said, &#8220;Nobody would have the balls to do this. You just wait — they&#8217;ll be freaking.&#8221; He was right. Prince made it the soundtrack&#8217;s first single — and 1984&#8217;s most avant-garde pop record became his first American Number One hit, keeping Bruce Springsteen&#8217;s &#8220;Dancing in the Dark&#8221; out of the top spot.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Swedish disco queen Robyn captured all the agony and ecstasy of twirling alone in a corner of the dance floor, spinning around in circles, and losing yourself in the beat for a moment of solitary triumph. “I think ‘Dancing on My Own’ is totally from me just being in clubs and going out and dancing a lot, and seeing people and thinking, ‘What are they doing here?’” she said later. Written with Stockholm producer Patrik Berger, the song made Robyn an iconic cult hero. But it also became the template for a whole generation of young songwriters, from Taylor Swift to Lorde, looking for the ideal glitter-and-sobs cocktail. “This song, to me, is perfect,” Lorde wrote. “Joyous even when a heart is breaking.”</p>\n",

Lennon knew he had written something special. In one of his last interviews, he declared &#8220;Imagine&#8221; to be as good as anything he had written with the Beatles.</p>\n",

Strawberry Field was the name of a Liverpool orphanage where he used to play — and hide from the world — as a boy. “I have visions of Strawberry Fields,” he told <i>Rolling Stone</i> in 1968. “Because Strawberry Fields is anywhere you want to go.” Lennon bared himself so vulnerably in this song that he was nervous about playing it for the other Beatles.

In 1970, Marvin Gaye was Motown&#8217;s top male vocal star, yet he was frustrated by the assembly-line role he played on his own hits. Devastated by the loss of duet partner Tammi Terrell, who died that March after a three-year battle with a brain tumor, Gaye was also trapped in a turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, Motown boss Berry Gordy&#8217;s sister. Gaye was tormented, too, by his relationship with his puritanical father, Marvin Sr.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If I was arguing for peace,&#8221; Gaye told biographer David Ritz, &#8220;I knew I&#8217;d have to find peace in my heart.&#8221; Not long after Terrell&#8217;s passing, Renaldo Benson of the Four Tops presented Gaye with a song he had written with Motown staffer Al Cleveland. But Gaye made the song his own, overseeing the arrangement and investing the topical references to war and racial strife with private anguish. Motown session crew the Funk Brothers cut the stunning, jazz-inflected rhythm track (Gaye joined in with cardboard-box percussion). Then Gaye invoked his own family in moving prayer: singing to his younger brother Frankie, a Vietnam veteran (&#8220;Brother, brother, brother/There&#8217;s far too many of you dying&#8221;), and appealing for calm closer to home (&#8220;Father, father, father/We don&#8217;t need to escalate&#8221;).</p>\n<p>Initially rejected as uncommercial, &#8220;What&#8217;s Going On&#8221; (with background vocals by two players from the Detroit Lions) was Gaye&#8217;s finest studio achievement, a timeless gift of healing.</p>\n",

The insidious hooks also showed his admiration for John Lennon. Cobain &#8220;had that dichotomy of punk rage and alienation,&#8221; Vig said, &#8220;but also this vulnerable pop sensibility. In &#8216;Teen Spirit,&#8217; a lot of that vulnerability is in the tone of his voice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sadly, by the time of Nirvana&#8217;s last U.S. tour, in late 1993, Cobain was tortured by the obligation to play &#8220;Teen Spirit&#8221; every night. &#8220;There are many other songs that I have written that are as good, if not better,&#8221; he claimed. But few songs by any artist have reshaped rock and roll so immediately, and permanently.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>“I wrote it. I didn’t fail. It was straight,” Bob Dylan said of his greatest song shortly after he recorded it in June 1965. There is no better description of “Like a Rolling Stone” — of its revolutionary design and execution — or of the young man, just turned 24, who created it.</p>\n<p>Dylan began writing an extended piece of verse — 20 pages long by one account, six in another — that was, he said, “just a rhythm thing on paper all about my steady hatred, directed at some point that was honest.” Back home in Woodstock, New York, over three days in early June, Dylan sharpened the sprawl down to that confrontational chorus and four taut verses bursting with piercing metaphor and concise truth.</p>\n<p>Before going into Columbia Records’ New York studios to cut it, Dylan summoned Mike Bloomfield, the guitarist in the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, to Woodstock to learn the song. “He said, ‘I don’t want you to play any of that B.B. King shit, none of that fucking blues,’” recalled Bloomfield (who died in 1981). “‘I want you to play something else.’”</p>\n<p>Just as Dylan bent folk music’s roots and forms to his own will, he transformed popular song with the content and ambition of “Like a Rolling Stone.” And in his electrifying vocal performance, his best on record, Dylan proved that everything he did was, first and always, rock &amp; roll. “‘Rolling Stone’ is the best song I wrote,” he said flatly at the end of 1965. It still is.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>In 1963, Sam Cooke — America&#8217;s first great soul singer and one of the most successful pop acts in the nation, with 18 Top 30 hits since 1957 — heard a song that profoundly inspired and disturbed him: Bob Dylan&#8217;s &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind.&#8221; What struck Cooke was the challenge implicit in Dylan&#8217;s anthem. &#8220;Jeez,&#8221; Cooke mused, &#8220;a white boy writing a song like that?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cooke&#8217;s response, &#8220;A Change Is Gonna Come,&#8221; recorded on January 30th, 1964, with a sumptuous orchestral arrangement by Rene Hall, was more personal — in its first-person language and the experiences that preceded its creation. On October 8th, 1963, while on tour, Cooke and members of his entourage were arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, for disturbing the peace after they tried to register at a white motel — an incident reflected in the song&#8217;s third verse. And Cooke&#8217;s mourning for his 18-month-old son, Vincent, who drowned that June, resonates in the last verse: &#8220;There have been times that I thought/I couldn&#8217;t last for long.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On December 11th, 1964, almost a year after he recorded it, Cooke was fatally shot at an L.A. motel. Two weeks later, &#8220;A Change Is Gonna Come&#8221; was released, becoming Cooke&#8217;s farewell address and an anthem of the civil rights movement.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>When Aretha Franklin left Columbia Records for Atlantic in 1966, the label’s vice president, Jerry Wexler, came to the singer with some suggestions for songs she might cover, like Sam Cooke’s “A Change Is Gonna Come” and Ray Charles’ “Drown in My Own Tears.” She liked those ideas, but she had one of her own: “Respect,” a song she’d been performing live. “Long as she changes it up,” Wexler told Franklin’s manager Ted White in an exchange recounted by Franklin’s biographer David Ritz. “You don’t gotta worry about that,” White responded. “She changes it up all right.”</p>\n<p>Otis Redding wrote &#8220;Respect&#8221; and recorded it for the Stax/Volt label in 1965. But Franklin took possession of the song for all time with her definitive cover, cut at Atlantic&#8217;s New York studio on Valentine&#8217;s Day 1967. &#8220;Respect&#8221; was her first Number One hit and the single that established her as the Queen of Soul.</p>\n<p>In Redding&#8217;s reading, a brawny march, he called for equal favor with volcanic force. Franklin wasn&#8217;t <em>asking</em> for anything. She sang from higher ground: a woman calling for an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority. In short: If you want some, you will earn it. &#8220;For Otis, &#8216;respect&#8217; had the traditional connotation, the more abstract meaning of esteem,&#8221; Wexler said in his autobiography, <i>Rhythm and the Blues: A Life in American Music</i>. &#8220;The fervor in Aretha&#8217;s magnificent voice demanded that respect and more: Respect also involved sexual attention of the highest order. What else could &#8216;Sock it to me&#8217; mean?&#8221;</p>\n<p>He was referring to the knockout sound of Franklin&#8217;s backup singers — her sisters, Carolyn and Erma — chanting &#8220;Sock it to me&#8221; at high speed, which Aretha and Carolyn cooked up for the session. The late Tom Dowd, who engineered the date, credited Carolyn with the saucy breakdown in which Aretha spelled out the title: &#8220;I fell off my chair when I heard that!&#8221; And since Redding&#8217;s version had no bridge, Wexler had the band — the legendary studio crew from Muscle Shoals, Alabama — play the chord changes from Sam and Dave&#8217;s &#8220;When Something Is Wrong With My Baby&#8221; under King Curtis&#8217; tenor-sax solo.</p>\n<p>There is no mistaking the passion inside the discipline of Franklin&#8217;s delivery; she was surely drawing on her own tumultuous marriage at the time for inspiration. &#8220;If she didn&#8217;t live it,&#8221; Wexler said, &#8220;she couldn&#8217;t give it.&#8221; But, he added, &#8220;Aretha would never play the part of the scorned woman.… Her middle name was Respect.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Leading off her Atlantic debut, <i>I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You</i>, “Respect” catalyzed rock &amp; roll, gospel, and blues to create the model for soul music that artists still look to today (Mariah Carey called Franklin &#8220;my mentor&#8221;). Just as important, the song’s unapologetic demands resonated powerfully with the civil rights movement and emergent feminist revolution, fitting for an artist who donated to the Black Panther Party and sang at the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. In her 1999 memoir, Franklin wrote that the song reflected &#8220;the need of the average man and woman in the street, the businessman, the mother, the fireman, the teacher — everyone wanted respect.” We still do.</p>\n",
